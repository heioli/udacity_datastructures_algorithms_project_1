# Project 1 of Udacities Datastructure and Algorithm Nano degree: Unscramble Computer Science Problems

A series of 4 short programming excercises to apply python knowledge to simple programming problems. 

## Project Overview Description

"In this project, you will complete five tasks based on a fabricated set of calls and texts exchanged during September 2016. You will use Python to analyze and answer questions about the texts and calls contained in the dataset. Lastly, you will perform run time analysis of your solution and determine its efficiency."
